This is an outline and checklist of our personal finance plan. I wanted to share
this as a starting point for others to form their own plan, and also to get
feedback on what we can improve. If you have a suggestion, feel free to [file an
issue](https://github.com/jch/personal-finance/issues) or email me at
jollyjerry@gmail.com.

## Debt

* Pay off loans
* Never keep a balance on credit cards, autopay everything in full
* Ask for a credit increase every 6 months
* Refinance for a lower interest rate on mortgages or large loans

## Short term savings

Savings for the upcoming 4 years.

* Enough cash for emergencies and upcoming large purchases. e.g. cars, weddings,
  kids, college, accidents, vacations
* Charitable giving. Contributions to eligible organizations can be itemized as
  a deduction
  
## Long term savings

Savings for the upcoming 15 years.

* Health Savings Account (HSA)
* 529 plan - saving for education expenses
* ??? *I don't know what I'm doing* :money_with_wings:

## Retirement savings

Savings for when I'm old as dirt.

* 401k. At least as much as any employer matching, more if possible.
  Traditional 401k is pretax, Roth 401k's sometimes available.
* Individual Retirement Account (IRA)


## Tools

* Monthly review of spending with [Mint](https://www.mint.com). Categorize
  spending, note any large differences in monthly trends.

## Questions

If you have investments that earn at a faster rate than your loans, then you
still come out ahead money-wise. I try to stay debt free as much as possible
because it simplifies my finances and gives me peace of mind. The exception
being my home mortgage, which is just too big to pay off quickly and provides
some tax benefits.
