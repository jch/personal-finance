This is an outline of our personal finance plan. Feel free to fork it and make your own!

## Debt

* Pay off highest interest loans first, keep loans with rates lower than inflation
* Auto pay credit cards
* Carry less than 1/3 of credit limit in credit card balance. Ask for credit limit increases if needed.
* [Check credit score](https://www.annualcreditreport.com) once a year. [CreditKarma](https://www.creditkarma.com) has a better interface and suggestions for improving credit score.
* Refinance for a lower interest rate on mortgages or large loans

## Loans

* Ask mortgage lender for a half dozen pre-approval letters in 25k increments up to the max. Prevents seller from seeing your max purchase power.
* Consider [401k](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-loans) loans. Up to $50k, prime rate, and interest and principal are both paid back into the account
* Consider personal loans or personal line of credit for debt consolidation. Example "First Republic Personal Line of Credit" 2.25 - 3.5%, interest only first 2 years, then amortized for remainder of the loan. Total terms from 5 - 10 years.
* Consider using a "box spread" for borrow cash quickly without underwriting.

## Liquidity

* 12 months of expenses in a high interest savings account
* Consider tax-exempt treasury funds like FDLXX if in a high tax state. [The Finance Buff](https://thefinancebuff.com/state-tax-exempt-treasury-fund-etf.html)
* Budget out large purchases into monthly amounts to save. e.g. car, wedding, vacation
* "Liquidity access lines" to borrow against your portfolio

## Equity compensation

* [The Open Guide to Equity Compensation](https://github.com/jlevy/og-equity-compensation)
* [Consider Your Options](http://www.amazon.com/Consider-Your-Options-Equity-Compensation/dp/1938797027/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)

## Medical

* Health Savings Account (HSA). Maximize employer contributions.
  * Do not invest until balance would exceed minimum to avoid fees
  * Choose a plan that allows investment in index funds like Wells Fargo or Health Savings Administrators
  * Continue to pay medical expenses out of pocket when possible to maximize tax deferred growth
  * No penalties for non-medical withdrawals after 65. Can use as [another retirement account](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091615/how-use-your-hsa-retirement.asp).

## Retirement

* [Pay less taxes](docs/taxes.md) - guide to tax advantaged accounts
* [Choose a Retirement Plan](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4484.pdf) IRS overview of different plan types. Highlights the benefits of each.
* [IRS Rollover Chart](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rollover_chart.pdf) shows what retirement plans can be rolled over.
* Calculate whether Traditional or Roth contribution makes sense for your tax bracket. [calculator](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/2qua49/roth_vs_traditional_calculator/cn9l3x2). Typically, high income/high tax rate => traditional, low income/low tax rate => roth. Save on taxes now vs save on taxes later.
* Maximize contributions to tax advantaged accounts: 401k, IRA, HSA.
* [Backdoor Roth IRA](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Backdoor_Roth_IRA). Pay special attention to [IRA aggregation rule and pro-rata distributions](https://www.kitces.com/blog/the-impact-of-the-ira-aggregation-rule-on-after-tax-distributions-roth-conversions-60-day-rollovers-rmds-and-72t-payments/), and the [consequences of 'step doctrine' for audits](https://www.kitces.com/blog/how-to-do-a-backdoor-roth-ira-contribution-while-avoiding-the-ira-aggregation-rule-and-the-step-transaction-doctrine/)
* [After-tax 401k contributions](https://www.kitces.com/blog/irs-notice-2014-54-acquiesces-on-splitting-after-tax-401k-contributions-for-roth-conversion/) and [rollovers](https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Rollovers-of-After-Tax-Contributions-in-Retirement-Plans)
* Choose low cost index funds.
* Charitable giving. Contributions to eligible organizations can be itemized as a deduction. Donor Advised Funds (DAF) can deduct from high tax years and defer gifts until later.
* [EarlyRetirementNow: Safe Withdrawal Rate series](https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/)

## Children

* [529 plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/529_plan). For non-qualified expenses, principal can be withdrawn without penalty, but withdrawals will be proportional principal and earnings. [source](https://www.kiplinger.com/article/college/T002-C001-S003-spending-leftover-money-529-college-savings-plan.html)
* [Vanguard 529](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/whatweoffer/college/vanguard529)
  * $3,000 minimum
  * Age based options. I'm using the "moderate" option: starts at 75/25 stock/bond allocation
* Dependent care FSA. [IRS publication 503](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p503.pdf)

## Tools

* [jch.app](https://jch.app) investment, networth, dividend tracking
* Review of spending with [Personal Capital](https://pcap.rocks/j75869) or Fidelity Full View. Categorize spending, note any large differences in monthly trends. Link all accounts.
* [ProjectionLab](https://projectionlab.com) retirement plans, draw down visualizer.

## Brokerages

- Merril: Integrates well with Bank of America for retail banking, Preferred Rewards program good for credit cards, loan discounts. Money market funds don't pay interest by default
- Morgan Stanley: Felt harder to self service. Amex Platinum paired card.
- Fidelity: Great phone support, free wires, 2% cashback card.
- Vanguard: I like the simplicity of their website, and mobile app. I use it for our IRA, Roth IRAs, and 529.
