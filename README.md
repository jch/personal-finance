This is an outline and checklist of our personal finance plan. I wanted to share
this as a starting point for others to form their own plan, and also to get
feedback on what we can improve. If you have a suggestion, feel free to [file an
issue](https://github.com/jch/personal-finance/issues) or email me at
jollyjerry@gmail.com.

## Debt

* Pay off loans
* Never keep a balance on credit cards, autopay everything in full
* Ask for a credit increase every 6 months, don't over do it
* Carry less than 1/3 of credit limit in credit card balance
* Check credit score once a year
* Refinance for a lower interest rate on mortgages or large loans

## Liquidity

* 12 months of expenses
* Budget out large purchases into monthly amounts to save. e.g. car, wedding, vacation

## Medical

* Health Savings Account (HSA). Maximize employer contributions.
  1) Do not invest until balance would exceed minimum to avoid fees
  2) preferably a plan that allows investment in index funds like Wells Fargo or Health Savings Administrators
  3) Continue to pay medical expenses out of pocket when possible to maximize tax deferred growth

## Retirement

* 401k. At least as much as any employer matching, more if possible.
  Traditional 401k is pretax, Roth 401k's sometimes available.
* Individual Retirement Account (IRA)
* Charitable giving. Contributions to eligible organizations can be itemized as
  a deduction
* Stick to low cost index funds. Fees matter.

## Tools

* Monthly review of spending with [Mint](https://www.mint.com). Categorize
  spending, note any large differences in monthly trends. Link all accounts.
* Vanguard brokerage account. Using this for our Roth IRA and IRA.
* Setup direct deposit and autopay for all accounts.
