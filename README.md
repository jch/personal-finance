This is an outline and checklist of our personal finance plan. I wanted to share
this as a starting point for others to form their own plan, and also to get
feedback on what we can improve. If you have a suggestion, feel free to [file an
issue](https://github.com/jch/personal-finance/issues) or email me at
jollyjerry@gmail.com.

## Debt

* Pay off loans
* Never keep a balance on credit cards, autopay everything in full
* Ask for a credit increase every 6 months
* Refinance for a lower interest rate on mortgages or large loans

## Liquidity

* 12 months of expenses
* Budget out large purchases into monthly amounts to save. e.g. car, wedding, vacation

## Medical

* Health Savings Account (HSA). Maximize employer contributions.
  1) Do not invest until balance would exceed minimum to avoid fees
  2) preferably a plan that allows investment in index funds like Wells Fargo or Health Savings Administrators
  3) Continue to pay medical expenses out of pocket when possible to maximize tax deferred growth

## Retirement

* 401k. At least as much as any employer matching, more if possible.
  Traditional 401k is pretax, Roth 401k's sometimes available.
* Individual Retirement Account (IRA)
* Charitable giving. Contributions to eligible organizations can be itemized as
  a deduction
* Stick to low cost index funds. Fees matter.

## Tools

* Monthly review of spending with [Mint](https://www.mint.com). Categorize
  spending, note any large differences in monthly trends. Link all accounts.
* Vanguard brokerage account. Using this for our Roth IRA and IRA.
* Setup direct deposit and autopay for all accounts.

If you have investments that earn at a faster rate than your loans, then you
still come out ahead money-wise. I try to stay debt free as much as possible
because it simplifies my finances and gives me peace of mind. The exception
being my home mortgage, which is just too big to pay off quickly and provides
some tax benefits.
