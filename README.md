This is an outline and checklist of our personal finance plan. I wanted to share
this as a starting point for others to form their own plan, and also to get
feedback on what we can improve. If you have a suggestion, feel free to [file an
issue](https://github.com/jch/personal-finance/issues) or email me at
jollyjerry@gmail.com.

## Debt

* Pay off loans
* Never keep a balance on credit cards, autopay everything in full
* Ask for a credit increase every 6 months
* Refinance for a lower interest rate on mortgages or large loans
* Extra principal payments earn an instant ROI equal to your interest rate times 1+(your tax rate). It is hard to guarantee a 6% ROI annually on any investment. Prepay when possible.
* Get to 22% equity and drop PMI.

## Short term savings

* Enough cash for emergencies and upcoming large purchases. e.g. cars, weddings,
  kids, college, accidents, vacations
* It's OK to keep this in your brokerage sweep account. In fact, have your direct deposit put there and schedule a transfer to your checking account in an amount that covers your budgeted expenses. 

## Long term savings

* 401k. At least as much as any employer matching, more if possible.
  Traditional 401k is pretax, Roth 401k's sometimes available.
* Individual Retirement Account (IRA)
* Charitable giving. Contributions to eligible organizations can be itemized as
  a deduction
* Stick to low cost index funds. Fees matter. 
* If possible, use alternate weighting in your index funds (equal weight or similar) as opposed to market-cap weighting. 
* One should omit complex, laborious, expensive, unreliable tactics that are alleged by some to enable one to achieve higher returns than the stock market average.


## Annual Budgets
* Save more money annually by making small monthly adjustments. 
* Buy items in bulk if we will use them over the course of a year. A 10% discount on a case of wine (that we would buy by the bottle anyway) is an instant 10% return (actually more, but read The Only Investment Guide since it's complex math.)
* Caulk all of the drafty parts of the house. Best investment possible.
* Annually, review all expense categories in aggregate (eg. $1200 for cable TV). Find ways to reduce those numbers (eg. $90 for Netflix) and save or invest the difference ($1110 goes to your brokerage). 
* Set annual goals for your financial account balances. See goals.ods. When you hit a goal, celebrate. 

## Extras

* Health Savings Account (HSA) - 1) Do not invest until balance would exceed minimum to avoid fees 2) preferably a plan that allows investment in index funds like Wells Fargo or Health Savings Administrators 3) Continue to pay medical expenses out of pocket when possible to maximize tax deferred growth
* 529 plan - saving for education expenses
* Brokerage Account - Keep at least *some* post-tax invements in stocks, even if you replicate the holdings of a mutual fund or index. Sell your losers for tax-loss harvesting, use your winners to fund charitable giving. 

## Tools

* Monthly review of spending with [Mint](https://www.mint.com). Categorize
  spending, note any large differences in monthly trends.
