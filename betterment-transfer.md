## Reasoning

- [Evaluating The Tax Deferral And Tax Bracket Arbitrage Benefits Of Tax Loss Harvesting](https://www.kitces.com/blog/evaluating-the-tax-deferral-and-tax-bracket-arbitrage-benefits-of-tax-loss-harvesting/). There is a benefit to TLH, but it does lower your basis and can be detrimental based on your current and future tax brackets.
- After looking at tax loss harvesting transactions Betterment performs, it doesn't seem difficult to do it yourself
- Betterments portfolios can be reconstructed for low fees without the management fee (0.25%)
- Comparing Betterment 90/10 porfolio against Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 (VFIFX), and a simple 60/40 US/International equity ETF (VTSAX / VTIAX) had [similar historical returns](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2019&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&showYield=true&reinvestDividends=true&benchmark=VFINX&symbol1=VTSAX&allocation1_1=60&symbol2=VTIAX&allocation2_1=40&symbol3=VFIFX&allocation3_2=100&symbol4=VTI&allocation4_3=31.9&symbol5=VTV&allocation5_3=8&symbol6=VOE&allocation6_3=6.9&symbol7=VBR&allocation7_3=5.8&symbol8=VEA&allocation8_3=23.1&symbol9=VWO&allocation9_3=14.3&symbol10=VTIP&allocation10_3=0.6&symbol11=AGG&allocation11_3=1.1&symbol12=MUB&allocation12_3=3.8&symbol13=BNDX&allocation13_3=3.0&symbol14=EMB&allocation14_3=1.5&total1=100&total2=100&total3=100.00)
- Fees: Betterment 0.35% (0.10% + 0.25% management fee), VFIFX 0.15%, VTSAX 60% * 0.04% + VTIAX 40% * 0.11% = 0.068%
